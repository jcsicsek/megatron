                  <p>We have experimented with several financing options in our retail store, but none were as flexible as tabb.io. Other vendors had inflexible products, low approval rates, or totally refused to work with us online. It is awesome that tabb.io can enable purchase plans for our customers online or in-store. And my technical team loves their API and developer tools, which make it easy to plug into our custom-built e-commerce software.</p>
